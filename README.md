# Selection-Sort
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted.
# Algorithm
Step 1: Set Min to location 0.  
Step 2: Look for the smallest element on the list.  
Step 3: Replace the value at location Min with a different value.  
Step 4: Increase Min to point to the next element  
Step 5: Continue until the list is sorted.
